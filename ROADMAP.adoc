= Cliodynamics.jl Roadmap

== Current Status

Beta release at v0.1.0. Core cliodynamic models implemented and tested. Julia package ready for community use and feedback.

== Completed Milestones

=== v0.1.0 - Core Models ✓
* [x] Malthusian population dynamics model
* [x] Demographic-structural theory (DST) model
* [x] Elite overproduction index calculation
* [x] Political stress indicator (PSI)
* [x] Secular cycle analysis and phase detection
* [x] State capacity model
* [x] Collective action problem modeling
* [x] Utility functions (moving average, detrend, normalize, etc.)
* [x] Comprehensive test suite (16 exported functions)
* [x] All tests passing

== In Progress

=== v0.2.0 - Examples & Data Integration
* [x] Julia usage examples (basic_usage.jl, historical_analysis.jl)
* [ ] Empirical dataset integration (Seshat Global History Databank)
* [ ] Plotting recipes for Plots.jl integration
* [ ] Model fitting to historical data utilities
* [ ] Parameter estimation with Optim.jl workflows

== Planned

=== v0.3.0 - Visualization & Documentation
* [ ] Interactive plotting with Makie.jl
* [ ] Documenter.jl comprehensive documentation
* [ ] Publication-quality figure generation
* [ ] Tutorial notebooks (Pluto.jl or Jupyter)

=== v1.0.0 - Production Release
* [ ] Bayesian inference support (Turing.jl integration)
* [ ] Spatial cliodynamic models (geographic extension)
* [ ] Agent-based model components
* [ ] Julia General registry submission
* [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization
* [ ] API stability guarantees

== Future Directions (v1.x+)

=== Advanced Methods
* Causal inference for historical processes
* Machine learning integration for pattern detection
* Network analysis for elite dynamics
* Time-varying parameter models

=== Ecosystem Integration
* Integration with economic history packages (Cliometrics.jl)
* Compatibility with DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem
* DataFrames.jl workflows for historical time series
* Interoperability with R cliodynamics packages

=== Domain Expansion
* Archaeological data analysis
* Climate-society interaction modeling
* Epidemiological-demographic models
* Institutional evolution analysis

== Community Goals

* Academic citations in cliodynamics research
* Collaboration with Complexity Science Hub Vienna
* Collaboration with Seshat Global History Databank
* Integration with Peter Turchin's research program
* JuliaCon presentation
* Publication in _Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution_
